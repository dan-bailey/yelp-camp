# yelp-camp
Final project from an online bootcamp. Mongo, Express, Node.

# to-do list
* clean up some layout issues in nav bar
* clean up the HTML santiziation and content security policy code (hey, I'm not actually going to deploy this to a live environment, and you probably shouldn't, either)
* celebrate the conclusion of the bootcamp
